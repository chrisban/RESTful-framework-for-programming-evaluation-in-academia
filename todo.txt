IN PROGRESS:
 
	- See getscript!

TODO: 
possible: initial ajax after quiz id??

different url per module, not defined in request? check restful standards
	
randomly rearrange items within a multiple choice question, and/or randomly populate a test with a subset of questions from a pool of available questions.


.js/.css file serving
	-> if GET: reroute with node/express? Move to resources folder on server

datafiles
	-> server should only parse if initial key parseInt != NaN
	-> add a 'prop' key for information such as test time, total points, etc.

timing:
	todo:
		- time elapsed, server get code
			-> date obj of start, start+time. freeze both and submit when difference = 0. Alert user @ 10 min, 5 min. etc.

		- floor numbers so they dont go into negatives

	questions:
		-save time elapsed? 
		- on question switch, prompt user for commit? (pause/save recc time for stats?)


- py example/interp

- admin datafile 
	-> json parser
		-> accepts well-formed and mal-formed JSON objects.
			-> <<>> denotes plaintext with line breaks and such that need formatting. ex: "<<plain text>>"

- lockdown browser (restricted urls - visit exam/docu, not google/SO/etc.)


- graphic related questions
	- feasability? did/didn't do it, why


mc finished: 
	done, can't look back or edit
	done, can look back, not edit

	not done, can't go forward or back

	datafile specifies


talk to drA/beckett about lockdown alternative
	- pointers?

--------------

Discussion:
- Web Security: Jason Gates, Ryan
	- disable clipboard
	- screenshots?
	- ways to circumvent/gain advantages
	Ans:
	- eval namespace
	- Object.freeze()

*************
Completed:
- Navigation
	- Display one question at a time
	- Nav buttons to switch through problems
	- Display bookmarking/thumbnails for quick nav

- unique student tracking:
	- ID via initial modal?
	- What if entered incorrectly?

- Support for different question types
	done: 
		- server and templates support multiple choice or code based problems
		- Before leaving part one, alert user that part one can no longer be edited after beginning part two

- submit button submits answer to server
	done: 
		- gathers all code/inputs/problem type/student id/ etc. and submits to server
		- gather all multiple choice answers and submit to server.
		- compile and runs test cases on solution and student code.
		- record grade in flatfile.
		- client submit button warns of submission (modal)
		- report result/score to student (on full completion)
		- fix total score calc

timing:
	done:
		- suggested timer/progress bar
			- suggested time tag used to select easy -> hard progression
			- connect datafile difficulty to per question timing bars


**********
questions:

pegi:
	commiting per question?
	show grade as you go or end?
		- how much detail? 



lockdown browser
id session open
reset skeleton code
caching issues??
